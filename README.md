![SEEK_LOGO](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef5b8137-431b-4f71-bceb-4a699f8e0671)

S.E.E.K stands for "Sober, Empowered, Enriched, Knowing" - and is an Android mobile application developed in React Native to help addicts through recovery.

Langugaes used:
* Python (For training and deploying the AI model)
* JavaScript (For creating the application within React Native)
* SQL (For creating the MySQL database)

Architecture:

S.E.E.K is designed around three main strcutres - the offline, personal components, the online forum and the generative AI: Junko - a tuned version of the open source Llama 2-7b model from Meta.

**Frameworks:**
* React Native with Expo (main application framework)
* NodeJS with Express (to provide the API that communicates with the database)
* Flask (to provide the API that communicates with the AI model)
* Google Colab (to run the Flask API)
* Heroku (to host the Express API)
* JawsDB (to host the database)

Junko is a tuned version of the Llama 2-7b model from Meta - designed to generate relapse prevention plans based on inputs of addiction type - triggers for the addiction and the severity of the addiction on a scale of 0 to 1. The inputs are taken in via a quiz and this input is passed to an API call hosted via a Python Flask application. The output is then reparsed into a comprehensive relapse prevention plan with warning signs and coping strategies that are tailored to your addiction experience to better aid you through recovery.

S.E.E.K also turns the coping strategies generated by Junko into a daily pledge that the user is alerted to and can confirm each day - this way an addict can hold themself accountable and better fortify their mind on their journey to recovery.

**Other Features:**

* Clocks:
The user can create a clock with a custom name and set a goal for a specified number of days - the clock will track the current week of the streak in green - the user specified goal in yellow and the streak against their personal best in orange - this helps the user stay motivated as they can see their progress increasing from their last relapse in real time. This can also be switched to a calendar view - which displays the current day in green and any days where there have been relapses in red - along with a log of emotional progress that is presented as options to the user every day if the time is past 9PM GMT.

* Forum:
Connecting with others who are also struggling with addiction is a proven benefit for those in recovery - and this is why S.E.E.K has an online forum. Register for an account, make posts and comments - and report harmful posts so they can be looked over by a moderator. Help each other get through it!

* Journal:
Some thoughts are not for sharing - and this is where the private journal comes in. Addiction is a mental struggle - and sharing your thoughts - even if it is just writing them down to yourself - can be invaluable in ensuring your mind stays wher it needs to be to continue your recovery. The journal allows for multiple entries to be made a day - and shows any emotional data you may have logged that day to track your wellbeing progress alongside your thoughts.

* Learn:
S.E.E.K provides direct access to https://smartrecovery.org.uk/ to direct the user to external self-help addiction resources.

* Panic:
If the user fears an imminent relapse - they can make use of the panic button which will guide them through an exercise involving deep breathing and motivational words to help pull them out of their cravings.

* Daily quotes:
S.E.E.K makes use of the Zenquotes API to provide a motivational quote to the user each day.

**Future work:**

**Bugs**

* Quotes

Issue: the “this should not appear” message appears when initially loading the app after a new quote has been released by the Zenquotes API.

Potential fix: this is because the element loads before the asynchronous function completes – introducing “await” into the function calls and preventing the component from loading until a value is returned would likely fix this issue.

* Null relapse prevention plan

Issue: the most egregious bug in the system – you can put empty values in the quiz when making a call to the Junko API – this causes null values to be saved in the plan – thus breaking the route to the plan page and crashing the app.

Potential fix: ensure that empty values cannot be submitted on the quiz page using similar checks to the journal and forum.

* Empty post title

Issue: you can create a forum post with an empty title – this is not a breaking bug, but it is not the desired functionality.

Potential fix: ensure empty values cannot be submitted for the title using similar checks to the journal and post body.

* Journal entry list

Issue: the journal entries sometimes get scrambled in order.

Potential fix: ensure the entries returned by the SQL query are ordered as desired by modifying the query itself.

* Incorrect route

Issue: clicking the seek logo button in the header leads to the emotional tracking page as opposed to the home page.

Potential fix: change the route this button points to.


**Missing features**

* Registration error

If the user’s registration to the forum fails for whatever reason – there is no way of them knowing this. User feedback here is necessary.

Perhaps if the user fails to register – an alert should appear with the reason why – as currently there is no difference visually between a successful registration and a failed one.

* Notifications

The original specification had notifications in mind for when the user broke a set goal or a personal best. This is not implemented.

* Biometrics

For security – I originally intended to include a biometric login to the application – this does not exist but is a good idea for a future build.

* Read more/less

The text should be truncated on the post screen and the read more/less button should function to show/hide the end part of the post. This is not implemented and currently the button does nothing. This is a priority change for the next version of S.E.E.K.

* Empty goal

Saving a clock with an empty goal just removes the goal. It would be more prudent to either make this a permanent feature with an actual readable option on the edit menu or remove the ability to save an empty value for the goal


**Improvements**

* Better learning resources

Currently the learning resources just link the user to an external site. A custom database with tailored choices would make more sense but was infeasible at this time due to the time constraint of the project.

* Removing screen transitions in the forum

To easily refresh the screen when a new comment/post was added – I simply reloaded the page. This, however, ruined the call stack, and attempting to navigate backwards would bring you to the previous version of the page. Dynamically updating the page instead of reloading would be more complicated but much better from a user experience standpoint.

* Visuals

There are a number of visual issues in the application that ruin the aesthetics, particularly with the daily quotes box and viewing the app on a smaller screen. Making the application more responsive is crucial to resolving this.


**Optimisation**

* NoSQL

The current version of the system uses MySQL – which is a relational model. A more efficient approach would have been to use NoSQL – using a platform like MongoDB, as this is faster and easier to maintain.

* Llama

Upgrading the model to a faster, more powerful version of Llama that is not the one provided for free would improve Junko’s capabilities.


**Non-functional requirements**

* Compliance

The application does not let users delete their accounts – which is an imperative implementation should S.E.E.K be deployed publicly.

* Accessibility

Accessibility settings (dark mode, font size, etc.) would be good additions to help the visually impaired.

* Cross-platform

Building a version for IOS is feasible for future but has not yet been done.
