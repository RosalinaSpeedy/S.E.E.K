S.E.E.K is designed around three main strcutres - the offline, personal components, the online forum and the generative AI: Junko - a tuned version of the open source Llama 2-7b model from Meta.

Junko is a tuned version of the Llama 2-7b model from Meta - designed to generate relapse prevention plans based on inputs of addiction type - triggers for the addiction and the severity of the addiction on a scale of 0 to 1. The inputs are taken in via a quiz and this input is passed to an API call hosted via a Python Flask application. The output is then reparsed into a comprehensive relapse prevention plan with warning signs and coping strategies that are tailored to your addiction experience to better aid you through recovery.

S.E.E.K also turns the coping strategies generated by Junko into a daily pledge that the user is alerted to and can confirm each day - this way an addict can hold themself accountable and better fortify their mind on their journey to recovery.
